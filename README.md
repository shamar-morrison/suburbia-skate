## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shamar-morrison/suburbia-skate.git
    cd suburbia-skate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Prismic:**
    This project uses Prismic as a headless CMS. To connect to your own Prismic repository:
    - Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` (if it exists) or create a new `.env.local` file.
    - Add your Prismic repository API endpoint to the file. You can find this in your Prismic dashboard (`Settings > API & Security`).
      ```
      PRISMIC_ENDPOINT=https://your-repo-name.prismic.io/api/v2
      ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Next.js Turbopack.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
- `npm run slicemachine`: Starts the Prismic Slice Machine, which is a local development tool for creating and managing Slices.
